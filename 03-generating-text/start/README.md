# AI Code Reviewer - Starter

This is the starter version for Session 1. The UI is already built - your job is to implement the AI functionality.

## What's Complete
- Frontend UI (`app/session-1/page.tsx`)
- Basic API route structure (`app/api/review/route.ts`)
- All dependencies and configuration

## What You Need to Implement
- AI code review logic in `app/api/review/route.ts`
- Use the AI SDK's `generateText()` function
- Create effective prompts for code review
- Handle AI responses and token usage

## Key File to Edit
- `app/api/review/route.ts` - Replace the TODO with actual AI implementation
